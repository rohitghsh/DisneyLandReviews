## Summary
The Disneyland Reviews Data Mining Project analyzed a large number of reviews of the Disneyland theme park for 3 locations namely California, Hong Kong and Paris to understand what people think about Disneyland. The project found that most people who visit Disneyland like it a lot and are happy while they are there. The rides and shows are very popular, but sometimes it can be very crowded and visitors have to wait in long lines. The food and drinks at Disneyland can be good, but some people think they are too expensive and not very tasty. The people who work at Disneyland are usually friendly and helpful, and keep the park clean. These findings can help Disneyland improve their operations and make the park a better experience for visitors.
